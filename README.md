🗳️ Decentralized Voting System
🔎 Overview
The Decentralized Voting System is a blockchain-based application that ensures secure, transparent, and trustless digital elections. It enables voters to cast their votes immutably on-chain for predefined candidates.

🎯 Project Vision
To provide a decentralized and tamper-proof alternative to traditional voting systems, significantly reducing fraud and increasing transparency in electoral processes.

🌟 Key Features
One vote per voter: Each Ethereum address is allowed to vote only once.

Valid candidate enforcement: Votes can be cast only for registered candidates.

Public result visibility: Voting outcomes are recorded and viewable on-chain.

Simple configuration: Candidate list can be customized during contract deployment.

🚧 Future Scope
Role-based voter registration: Allow only verified or authorized addresses to vote.

Time-restricted voting: Automatically end voting at a specific block timestamp.

Front-end integration: Connect the contract to a React or Next.js frontend with MetaMask support.

Enhanced privacy with ZKPs: Incorporate zero-knowledge proofs for private yet verifiable votes.
